<p style="">	We chose to use Laravel, a PHP framework to develope the 
openBook project. Our tech stack is the LAMP stack 
(Linux Apache MySQL PHP). Compared to newer projects 
and especially the ones I've seen in Rcos, this stack
isn't used fairly often, you tend to here the MEAN stack
in newer projects.
</p>
<p style="">	Although an older tech stack, it is still very flexible with
modern technology, for example we're opting to use postgresSQL
and using PHP/Python as our backend scripting language. 
An advantage of using PHP/Python is that we can quickly build
an internal API to let PHP interact with various Python scripts.
This allows for a powerful combination of the web's UI development
with Python's extensive libraries and language capacity. Specifically, 
we plan on creating a web version of our interpreter and we can easily 
link our interpreter from the openBooks-Core repo and build a repo around it

<b>But PHP is awful???</b>
<p style="">	PHP has a bad reputation but I think people like to make fun of it
because everyone else makes fun of it when in reality very few people who
criticize really use it.
There are a lot of advantages to using PHP:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>It's fast, like really fast</li>
	<li>great database support</li>
	<li>Powers a ton of the inter-net - which means great support!</li>
	<li>Its secure*</li>
	<li>Lots of tools for testing</li>
	<li>Stability and backwards comparability</li>
</ul>
<p style="">	*You may not associate security and PHP, but modern versions are very secure
and do an excellent job of protecting developers from themselves. Combined 
with a framework like laravel that handles some of the trickier parts like
routing, PHP can be a very secure language.
</p>
<p style="">	However, PHP is an old language so theres a lot of misinformation on how to
use it. PHP will also allows you to do whatever you want. Meaning where a number 
of other languages will warn or stop you from doing something stupid PHP typically
does not check for this (by default)
</p>
<p style="">	the reason for this is backwards compatibility, PHP has made great effort 
in ensuring new versions are backwards compatible (a concept not included in 
many new frameworks) as a result there are security holes that although are 
marked deprecated are still in the language which personally I think is a fair 
tradeoff.
</p>
<hr/ style = "justify-self:center;">	
<b>Ok PHP is fine but you didn't answer why laravel</b>
<p style="">	We choose laravel because we can spend more time developing our application, typically
PHP requires you to set up a lot of infrastructure that we don't have the resources for.
This allows us to quickly get going and also to use well developed features that we're 
not familiar with like routing and database interactions.
</p>
<p style="">	Laravel also has a great test environments. Our setup uses Vagrant to develop. New
developers only need to install virtual box + vagrant and simple do a 'vagrant up' to 
build their test environment. This allows us to have one target OS which will be the 
server OS and everyone else can have a pretty code model of what that setup will look like on their computer.
