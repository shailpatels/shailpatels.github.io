</h1>
<hr/ style = "justify-self:center;">	
<p style="">	Athena is a programming language and theorem prover 
	developed by Konstantine Arkoudas. Athena allows for 
	the development of proofs that are both human readable
	and machine-checkable.
</p>
<h2 id = "subtitle1" style="justify-self : center;">	Introduction
</h2>
<p style="">	Formal proof methods are typically used in the area of
	software verification in computer science. The central
	focus is program correctness which aims to validate 
	the behavior of a program. Key properties such as 
	type checking, verifying inputs and outputs, and proof
	of termination are all areas which can be formally checked
	for correctness.
</p>
<h2 id = "subtitle2" style="justify-self : center;">	Installation & Setup
</h2>
<p style="">	Athena downloads can be found here:
</p>
<a href = "http://proofcentral.org/athena/1.4/" alt = "" target = "_blank" style="justify-self : center;">	http://proofcentral.org/athena/1.4/
</a>
<p style="">	Once downloaded extract and execute the 'athena' binary after installation.
	This will start the Athena interactive shell, you enter quit or CTRL + C to
	exit.
</p>
<p style="">	You can create an environment variable called 'ATHENA_HOME' that points to
	where you installed Athena to run the program in any location.
</p>
<p style="">	On Linux: you can edit your bashrc, open ~/.bashrc with your favorite 
	text editor and enter this line.
</p>
<pre class = "prettyprint">
	export ATHENA_HOME=~/Athena/athena-linux
</pre>
<p style="">	Replace the path after 'ATHENA_HOME=' with where you installed Athena to.
	Now add an alias in your bashrc
</p>
<pre class = "prettyprint">
	alias Athena='$ATHENA_HOME/athena'
</pre>
<p style="">	Remember to reload your bashrc by entering 'source ~/.bashrc'.
	After that you should be able to type 'Athena' and enter the shell
	just like before.
</p>
<h2 style="">	Loading Files
</h2>
	</h2>
<p style="">	You can also write Athena programs inside of a .ath file and load them into a
shell. This can be done with the command:
</p>
<pre class = "prettyprint">
	load "example.ath";;
</pre>
<p style="">	The command "clear-assumption-base" will
remove any theorems and values typed or loaded 
from files.
</p>
<hr/ style = "justify-self:center;">	
<h1 id="title2" style = "justify-self : center;;">	Propositional Logic
</h1>
<p style="">	Boolean logic (e.g 0th order or propositional logic) is considered a 
	primitive in Athena and many other proof
	methods are built on top of propositional logic. Athena can be used a 
	proof language where propositional and higher order logic systems can 
	be expressed and verified for correctness.
</p>
<h2 id = "subtitle3" style="justify-self : center;">	Common Rules
</h2>
<div style = "max-width:100vw;">	$$
 	\begin{align}
 	&\frac{A, B}{\therefore A \land B} && \text{Conjunction Introduction} \\~\\

 	&\frac{A \land B}{\therefore A, B} && \text{Conjunction Elimination}\\~\\

 	&\frac{A}{\therefore A \lor B} && \text{Disjunction Intro}\\~\\

 	&\frac{A \rightarrow C, B \rightarrow C, A \lor B }{ \therefore C } && \text{Disjunction Elimination}\\~\\

 	&\frac{\lnot \lnot A}{\therefore A} && \text{Double Negation}\\~\\

 	&\frac{A \rightarrow B, A}{\therefore B} && \text{Modus Ponens}\\~\\

 	&\frac{A \rightarrow B, \lnot B}{\therefore \lnot A}
 	&&\text{Modus Tollens}

 	\end{align}
 $$
</div>
<hr/ style = "justify-self:center;">	
<ul>
	<li>Conjunction Introduction : If two boolean atoms are asserted, then they can be conjuncted together.</li>
	<li>Conjunction Elimination : If two booleans are 
	conjuncted together, it implies both of them are asserted.</li>
	<li>Disjunction intro, if one atom is asserted you can 
	introduce any number of atoms disjuncted onto it. 
	E.g. If A represents the statement: "It is sunny outside",
	A or B can represent "It is sunny outside or it is raining dogs". This statement is technically true even though it 
	provides no additional information.</li>
	<li>Disjunction elim: If all cases lead to the same 
	conclusion then the disjunction can be eliminated.</li>
	<li>Double negation : E.g. Not Not A can be reduced 
	to A since the negations cancel.</li>
	<li>Modus Ponens: If A then B, given A we also have B.</li>
	<li>Modus Tollens: If A then B, given not B we also have not A.</li>
</ul>
<p style="">	These common rules map directly to Athena:
	Boolean is a primitive type already defined
	in the Athena's assumption base by default.
</p>

	let{

	(!claim (!mt cond nd) )

#((C ==> D) & (~D)) ==> (~C)
</pre>
<p style="">	Most Athena methods map to traditional methods
as you would expect. Certain functions used like
"let" allow multiple steps to be taken within the 
same context to preserve variables.
The "!claim" function asserts if a variable is in
the current context or not. The "assume" keyword
is used to introduce new variables in the form
of an assumption, notice all the theorems that
start with "assume" create a conditional which
maps to the natural language representation, "if A then ..."
</p>
<p style="">	Here is an example of a hypothetical syllogism
	using the above rules.
</p>
<pre class = "prettyprint">
	clear-assumption-base
declare A,B,C,D,E:Boolean

#hyp syl
define premise := ( (A ==> B) & (B ==> C) )
assume A
assume premise
	let{ left := (!left-and premise);
		 right := (!right-and premise);
		 b := (!mp left  A)
		}
	(!claim  (!mp right b))
</pre>
<p style="">	Hypothetical syllogism is a common method in logic, instead of 
defining a single theorem we could create a method we could
reuse. Similar to predefined methods like "(!mp)".
</p>
<pre class = "prettyprint">
	define (hs p1 p2) :=
	match [p1 p2] {
		[(a ==> b) (b ==> c)] =>
		assume a
		conclude c
			(!mp p2 conclude b
					(!mp p1 a))
	}
</pre>
<p style="">	The match keyword takes sentences and compares them with 
	predefined expected sentences, this prevents incorrect 
	inputs to be used with this function. 

	We can then use this function just like any other:
</p>
<pre class = "prettyprint">
	assert t := (A ==> B)
	assert s := (B ==> C)
	(!hs t s)
	#A ==> C
</pre>
<p style="">	Notice the resulting theorem is much cleaner and closer to what we 
	would expect compared to the first method.
</p>

<hr/ style = "justify-self:center;">	
<h1 id="title3" style="justify-self : center;">	First Order Logic
</h1>
<p style="">	First order Logic (FOL) introduces quantifiers that allow
reasoning over sets of objects. This is done by introducing
predicate that accept an atom. 

Sets and objects can be defined in Athena like:
</p>
<pre class = "prettyprint">
	declare S : [Object] -> Boolean
 	declare a : Object

 	define [x y z] := [?x ?y ?z]
</pre>
<p style="">	
</p>
<i style="">	The definition of x y z is there to prevent us from having to write ?x everywhere.
</i>
<p style="">	Quantifiers in First order logic allow us to express more, for example 
	boolean atoms are analogous to constants in FOL. In natural language
	words can quantify over a noun, for example "every student", "exactly 3",
	"no person", etc. All these phrases express information over an entire set
	of objects. There are two types of quantifiers, forall: ∀, and exists: ∃.
	Forall is usually indicated by statements like "every", "all", "anything".
	Exists is usually indicated by "something", "at least one thing", "there exists" .
</p>
<p style="">	We can now express statements like : All students are smart or someone is in class.
</p>
<div style = "max-width:100vw;">	$$
		\forall x \, Student(x) \rightarrow Smart(x)\\~\\
		\exists x \, InClass(x)
	$$
</div>
<h2 id = "subtitle5" style="justify-self : center;">	Athena Examples
</h2>
<pre class = "prettyprint">
	declare Student : [Object] -> Boolean
	declare Smart : [Object] -> Boolean
	declare InClass : [Object] -> Boolean

	(forall x . Student x ==> Smart x )
	(exists x . InClass x)
</pre>
<p style="">	We can draw a conclusion from a FOL sentence by the process 
	of universal specification or universal
	instantiation. This is done by the method "uspec"
	which takes a FOL sentence in the assumption base and the 
	second is the term to specialize onto the sentence.
</p>
<pre class = "prettyprint">
	assert t := (forall x . Smart x)
	declare a : Object
	(!uspec t a)

	# Theorem: (Smart a)
</pre>
<p style="">	Introducing universal quantifiers. The "(!reflex x)" 
	function will produce the equality x = x. We can 
	universally quantify this function to create the sentence
	"for every x, x is equal to itself" which is a true statement
	in FOL as "forall x . x = x"
</p>
<pre class = "prettyprint">
	pick-any p (!reflex )

	#Theorem: (forall ?p:'S
	#		(= ?x:'T ?x:'T))
</pre>
<p style="">	The function uspec can be paired with this sentence for any 
	atom
</p>
<pre class = "prettyprint">
	define self := pick-any x (!reflex x)

	(!uspec self true)
	(!uspec self z)
	(!uspec self (y > x) )
</pre>
<p style="">	A similar function exists for working with existential quantifiers,
	the function egen handles existential generalization, which is the 
	reasoning that if some predicate applied to an atom is in the 
	assumption base then we can generalize there exists that predicate.
	This can be expressed as:
</p>
<div style = "max-width:100vw;">	$$
	P(a) \rightarrow \exists x \, P(x)
	$$
</div>
<p style="justify-self : center;">	This example shows that a universally quantified predicate implies an existential.
</p>
<div style = "max-width:100vw;">	$$
	\forall x \, Smart(x) \rightarrow \exists x \, Smart(x)
	$$
</div>
<p style="justify-self : center;">	It should be intuitive that if all things are smart, there exists at least one
	thing that is smart
</p>
<pre class = "prettyprint">
	declare a : Object
	define goal := (exists x . Smart x)

	assume allSmart := (forall x . Smart x)
		conclude goal
		let {smartA := (!uspec allSmart a) }
		(!claim (!egen goal a ))
</pre>
<h1 id="title4" style = "justify-self : center;;">	Numeric Expressions in Athena
</h1>
<p style="">	One way to define natural numbers is through the Peano Axioms,
	which uses First Order Logic.

	The syntax required are 0 and the successor function S(x).
	The successor function returns the next value in the sequence.
</p>
<p style="">	Peano Numbers:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>0</li>
	<li>S(0)</li>
	<li>S(S(0))</li>
	<li>S(S(S(0)))</li>
	<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p style="">	Peano Axioms:
</p>
<div style = "max-width:100vw;">	$$
		\begin{align}
		&\forall x \, 0 \neq S(x) \\ & \text{0 is the first number}\\~\\
		&\forall x, \forall y \, \, S(x) = S(y) \rightarrow x = y \\& \text{If the successor of x and y are equal, x and y must be equal  } \\~\\
		&\forall x \, x + 0 = x \\ &  \text{0 plus anything is itself}\\~\\
		&\forall x, \forall y \, \, x + S(y) = S(x + y) \\& \text{ x plus the successor of y is the successor of x and y  }\\~\\
		&\forall x, x \cdot 0 = 0\\ & \text{0 times anything is 0}\\~\\
		&\forall x, \forall y \,\, x \cdot S(y) = x \cdot y + x\\
		&\text{x times the successor of y is x times y plus x, (the distributive law)}
		\end{align}
	$$
</div>
<p style="">	In order to introduce natural numbers a new datatype in Athena needs to be introduced.
	A datatype is something that defines a type, an example is the Boolean which comes 
	predefined:
</p>
<pre class = "prettyprint">
	datatype Boolean := true | false

	domain Boolean
	declare true , false : Boolean
	assert ( true =/= false )
	assert ( forall ? b: Boolean . ?b = true | ?b = false )
</pre>
<p style="">	We can define a module to encapsulate the concept of a natural number. 
A module in Athena allows code to be separated for reuse in other places.
All definitions and assertions are contained within the scope of the module
</p>
<pre class = "prettyprint">
	datatype N := zero | (S N) # S is the Successor function

	module N{
		declare one : N
		declare + : [N N] -> N
		declare * : [N N] -> N

		define [n m] := [?n:N ?m:N]
		assert one-def := (one = S zero)


		assert Sn_not_zero  := (forall n . S n =/= zero )
		assert Sn_equals    := (forall n m . (S n = S m) ==> (n = m)  )
		assert n_plus_zero  := (forall n . n + zero = n ) 
		assert Sn_plus_m    := (forall n m . n + S m = S (n + m)  )
		assert n_times_0    := (forall n . n * zero = zero)
		assert Sn_times_m   := (forall n m . n * S m = (n * m) + n  )
	}
</pre>
<p style="">	Notice that the assumption base does need to be cleared sense 
	everything is self contained in the module and only gets loaded
	with the "open" command.
    A module allows predefined theorem to be created for reuse, 
    in the above example they are asserted to be true but proving them
    allows the use of Peono Axioms in other work without having to 
    redefine them.
</p>
<p style="">	Here is a simple example usage of the module. If the 
    theorem n_plus_zero was fully proven the following 
    theorem would be a robust theorem without having to reprove 
    the underlying theorems.
</p>
<pre class = "prettyprint">
	define goal := ( zero + zero = zero )
    conclude goal
        (!uspec n_plus_zero zero)
</pre>
<p style="">	This simple numeric module can be
    expanded to handle more theorems that can be used in more 
    complex proofs. In the future writing a proof could be as simple
    as importing a library just like in a programming language to write
    a more complex proof.
</p>
<h1 id="title5" style="justify-self : center;">	Implication Chaining
</h1>
<p style="">	Implication chaining allows connecting some starting term with
    a target term through n nonzero steps. Each step is justified 
    by some rule. Here is an example of using implication chaining
    in propositional logic.
</p>
<pre class = "prettyprint">
	declare A,B:Boolean
	(!chain [(A & B) ==> left-and])
</pre>
<p style="">	Although this could be accomplished by the traditional function 
	application of "left-and" this method is closer to a traditional
	proof approach where a starting premise goes through multiple
	steps towards a goal. This could be represented as:
</p>
<div style = "max-width:100vw;">	$$
		\begin{align}
			A &\land B && \text{ And elimination }\\
			A & \\
			\therefore \, & \, (A \land B) \rightarrow A
		\end{align}
	$$
</div>
<p style="">	Implication chaining can be done in reverse with the "<==" operation 
	or bidirectionally with "<==>". These steps can be used if at every
	step the correct direction can be derived for example:
</p>
<pre class = "prettyprint">
	(!chain [ (~~ A & (B ==> C)) <==> ((B ==> C) & ~~ A [comm]
				     <==> ((~C ==> ~B) & A  [contra-po bdn])) ])
</pre>
<p style="justify-self : center;">	The overall pattern of implication chaining can be represented as the
	following:
</p>
<div style = "max-width:100vw;">	$$
		\begin{align}
		\text{chain} \,\,\, t_1 &= t_2 & J_1 \\
					 	 &= t_3 & J_2\\
					 	 &.\\
					 	 &= t_{n+1} & J_n
		\end{align}
	$$
</div>
<p style="">	Where J are the justifications for every step and t are the different
	terms that lead to the final term.
